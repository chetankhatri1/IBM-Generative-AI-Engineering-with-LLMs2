    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to introduce you to the process of pretraining large language models (LLMs) using the popular Hugging Face library. Hugging Face is a leading open-source platform for natural language processing that provides a wide range of pretrained models and tools for fine-tuning and deploying these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn how to load pre-trained models from Hugging Face and make inferences using the Pipeline module. Additionally, you will learn how to further train pre-trained LLMs on your own data (self-supervised fine-tuning). By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to pretrain LLMs and store them to later fine-tune for your specific use cases. This will empower you to create powerful and customized natural language processing solutions.\n"

The objective is to enable the model to learn contextual understanding and fill in missing information.\n",
