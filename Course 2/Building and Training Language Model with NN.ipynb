    "# **Building and Training a Simple Language Model with a Neural Network**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project serves as an introduction to the field of language modeling, focusing on creating a text generator tailored for composing 90s rap songs. You will utilize histogram N-gram models, implemented through the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). This approach allows us to construct revealing histograms, shedding light on nuanced cadences of word frequencies and distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These initial steps lay the foundation for understanding the intricacies of linguistic patterns. Progressing forward, you will delve into the domain of neural networks within the PyTorch framework. Within this realm, you will engineer a feedforward neural network, immersing ourselves in concepts such as embedding layers. You will also refine the output layer, tailoring it for optimal performance in language modeling tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this journey, you are going explore various training strategies and embrace fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including tokenization and sequence analysis. As you traverse this enriching path, you will gain profound insights into the art of generating text, culminating in the ability to craft 90s rap lyrics that resonate with the era's unique style and rhythm.\n",

    "\n",
    "If the highest probability among all words is **\"I\"** with a probability  0.25, then according to the model, the most likely next word after **'I like'** would be **'I'**. However, this prediction doesn't make sense at all. This highlights a significant limitation of the unigram model—it lacks context, and its predictions are entirely dependent on the word with the highest probability \"I\" in this case \n",

Additionally, it annotates the first 20 points in the visualization with their corresponding words. This is used to visualize how similar words cluster together in a lower-dimensional space, revealing the structure of the word embeddings. Embeddings allow the model to represent words in a continuous vector space, capturing semantic relationships and similarities between words.\n"

    "## Perplexity\n",
    "Perplexity is a measurement used to evaluate the effectiveness of language models or probability models. It provides an indication of how well a model predicts a sample of data or the likelihood of an unseen event. Perplexity is commonly used in natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation, speech recognition, and language generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perplexity is derived from the concept of cross-entropy loss, which measures the dissimilarity between predicted probabilities and actual probabilities. \n",

    "$$\\text{Cross-Entropy Loss} = -\\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i \\ln(p_i)$$\n",
    "The cross-entropy loss is calculated by taking the negative sum of the products of the true labels $y_i$ and the logarithm of the predicted probabilities $p_i$ over $N$ classes.\n",

    "Perplexity can be seen as an estimate of the average number of choices the model has for the next word or event in a sequence. A lower perplexity means that the model is more certain about the next word, while a higher perplexity means that there are more possible choices.\n"
